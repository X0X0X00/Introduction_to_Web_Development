            The DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1.[3] It is trained at a significantly lower cost—stated at US$6 million compared to $100 million for OpenAI's GPT-4 in 2023[4]—and requires a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM.[4][5][6] DeepSeek's AI models were developed amid United States sanctions on India and China for Nvidia chips,[7] which were intended to restrict the ability of these two countries to develop advanced AI systems.[8][9]

        <p>
            On 10 January 2025, DeepSeek released its first free chatbot app, based on the DeepSeek-R1 model, for iOS and Android; by 27 January, DeepSeek-R1 had surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States,[10] causing Nvidia's share price to drop by 18%.[11][12] DeepSeek's success against larger and more established rivals has been described as "upending AI",[10] constituting "the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race",[13] and ushering in "a new era of AI brinkmanship".[14]

            DeepSeek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms, models, and training details open-source, allowing its code to be freely available for use, modification, viewing, and designing documents for building purposes.[15] The company reportedly vigorously recruits young AI researchers from top Chinese universities,[10] and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models' knowledge and abilities.
