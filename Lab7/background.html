            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                In February 2016, High-Flyer was co-founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, who had been trading since the 2007–2008 financial crisis while attending Zhejiang University.[16] By 2019, he established High-Flyer as a hedge fund focused on developing and using AI trading algorithms. By 2021, High-Flyer exclusively used AI in trading,[17] often using Nvidia chips.[18] DeepSeek has made its generative artificial intelligence chatbot open source, meaning its code is freely available for use, modification, and viewing. This includes permission to access and use the source code, as well as design documents, for building purposes.[15]

                In 2021, while running High-Flyer, Liang began stockpiling Nvidia GPUs for an AI project.[18] According to 36Kr, Liang had built up a store of 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs, which are used to train AI,[19] before the United States federal government imposed AI chip restrictions on China.[17]
                In April 2023, High-Flyer started an artificial general intelligence lab dedicated to research developing AI tools separate from High-Flyer's financial business.[20][21] Incorporated on 17 July 2023,[22] with High-Flyer as the investor and backer, the lab became its own company, DeepSeek.[17][23][21] Venture capital firms were reluctant to provide funding, as they considered it unlikely that the venture would be able to generate an "exit" in a short period of time.[17]

                After releasing DeepSeek-V2 in May 2024, which offered strong performance for a low price, DeepSeek became known as the catalyst for China's AI model price war. It was quickly dubbed the "Pinduoduo of AI", and other major tech giants such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba began to cut the price of their AI models to compete with the company. Despite the low price charged by DeepSeek, it was profitable compared to its rivals that were losing money.[24]
                DeepSeek is focused on research and has no detailed plans for commercialization,[24] which also allows its technology to avoid the most stringent provisions of China's AI regulations, such as requiring consumer-facing technology to comply with the government's controls on information.[5]            
                DeepSeek's hiring preferences target technical abilities rather than work experience, resulting in most new hires being either recent university graduates or developers whose AI careers are less established.[21][5] Likewise, the company recruits individuals without any computer science background to help its technology understand other topics and knowledge areas, including being able to generate poetry and perform well on the notoriously difficult Chinese college admissions exams (Gaokao).[5]
