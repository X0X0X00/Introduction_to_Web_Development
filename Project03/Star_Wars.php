Additionally, with advances in AI, virtual production (e.g., LED Volume technology), and special effects, the visual presentation will be even more stunning, and may even incorporate new and emerging ways of experiencing the film such as VR/AR. Plot-wise, legendary characters that fans have been waiting for (e.g. Raven, Darth Plagueis) may be introduced into the canon, while new characters will further expand the galaxy's multiculturalism.</td>

            <h2>Interpretation of Core Settings</h2>
            <p>The Force is a mysterious and powerful energy field in the Star Wars universe. It permeates the entire galaxy and connects all living things. The Force has a light side and a dark side. The light side represents justice, kindness, and wisdom, while the dark side represents anger, fear, and greed. Jedi Knights use the light side of the Force to maintain peace and justice in the galaxy, while Sith Lords use the dark side to pursue power and domination.</p>
            <p>The lightsaber is an iconic weapon in Star Wars. It is made of plasma, and the hilt can emit a blade of different colors. Blue and green lightsabers are usually wielded by Jedi Knights, while red ones are used by Sith Lords. The lightsaber is not only a weapon for combat but also a symbol of the user's identity and Force ability.</p>
            <p>Hyperspace jump is an important means of interstellar travel. In the Star Wars universe, with the help of a hyperdrive, spaceships can travel at extremely high speeds in hyperspace, covering vast inter - galactic distances. This setting makes communication and trade between planets in the galaxy possible and provides a basis for the interstellar adventures in the story.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Luke Skywalker</h3>
                <p><em>Luke Skywalker</em> is one of the main characters in the Original Trilogy. He was originally an ordinary farm boy on the planet Tatooine. By chance, he met Obi - Wan Kenobi and was guided to learn the Force, becoming a Jedi Knight. Luke is brave, kind, and full of justice. He played a crucial role in the fight against the Galactic Empire and finally saved his father, Darth Vader, bringing him back to the light side. Luke changes his mind when he finds that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle. He and Obi-Wan travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. They hire the duo to take them to Alderaan on the Millenium Falcon, only to discover that it has been destroyed by the Death Star, the Empire's battle station. The Falcon is brought to the Death Star via tractor beam, and Luke and Han disguise themselves as stormtroopers to infiltrate the station. When they discover Leia is being held captive, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help rescue her. Obi-Wan deactivates the tractor beam, then sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader so the others can escape. Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and pilots an X-wing during the Battle of Yavin. He and other Rebels attempt to destroy the Death Star by launching torpedoes into an exhaust port. As he approaches the port, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice, telling him to trust his feelings. He switches off his ship's missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the torpedoes. After destroying the Death Star, Luke receives a medal of honor from Leia

                <h3>Princess Leia</h3>
                <p>Princess Leia is the princess of the planet Alderaan and an important leader of the Rebel Alliance. She is intelligent, resourceful, and fearless, playing a significant role in the fight against the Galactic Empire. Her love story with Han Solo also adds a romantic touch to the films. One of the more popular Star Wars characters, Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the now-noncanonical Star Wars Expanded Universe, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her "cinnamon bun" hairstyle from Star Wars (1977) and metal bikini from Return of the Jedi have become cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress for Star Wars and Return of the Jedi. She also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, the latter being a posthumous nomination.
