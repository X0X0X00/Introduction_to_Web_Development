        I'm a Computer Science and Business double major at the University of Rochester &hearts; with a strong interest in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>. 
        I enjoy working on projects related to <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em>Data Analysis</em>, and <em>Machine Learning</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Beyond academics, I have actively participated in various projects and competitions. 
        For instance, I developed a <strong>Multi-Layer Perceptron model</strong> in the Goergen Biomedical Data Science Hackathon, 
        successfully predicting the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. 
        Additionally, my internship experiences in mobile app data analysis and software development allowed me to utilize predictive modeling techniques, 
        such as <em>Logistic Regression</em> and <em>LightGBM</em>, to generate actionable insights.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As a responsible and driven individual, I also take part in campus leadership activities. 
        I currently serve as the <strong>Minister of Publicity</strong> for the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at the University of Rochester. 
        Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of technology and business, 
        striving to create innovative, data-driven solutions that make a meaningful impact.
