Task 1:

    Declare three variables:
        studentName (a string to store a student's name)
        studentAge (a number to store the student's age)
        studentGrades (an empty array to store the student's test scores)

    Prompt the user for their name and age using the prompt() function, and store the values in the corresponding variables.

    Print the following message to the console:
    "Student's name is [studentName] and they are [studentAge] years old."

---

Task 2:

    Prompt the user to enter 5 test scores, one at a time. Store each score in the studentGrades array.
    After all the scores are entered, print the entire array to the console.

Complete the following code for Task 2:

let studentGrades = [];

// add your code here

console.log("Student Grades:", studentGrades);

---

Task 3:

    Write a function calculateAverage() that takes the studentGrades array as input and returns the average score.
    After calculating the average, print it to the console in this format:
    "The average score is [averageScore]."

Complete the following code for Task 3:

function calculateAverage(grades) {
	// add your own code here
}

let averageScore = calculateAverage(studentGrades);
console.log(`The average score is ${averageScore}.`);

---

Task 4:

    Write two functions: findHighestScore() and findLowestScore().
        findHighestScore() should return the highest score in the studentGrades array.
        findLowestScore() should return the lowest score in the array.

    Print both the highest and lowest scores to the console in the following format:
    "The highest score is [highestScore]."
    "The lowest score is [lowestScore]."

Complete the following code for Task 4:

function findHighestScore(grades) {
	// add your own code here
}

function findLowestScore(grades) {
 // add your own code here
}

let highestScore = findHighestScore(studentGrades);
let lowestScore = findLowestScore(studentGrades);

console.log(`The highest score is ${highestScore}.`);
console.log(`The lowest score is ${lowestScore}.`);

---

Bonus Task:

    Write a function called gradeAnalysis() that analyzes the student's grades.
        If the average score is 90 or above, print "Excellent performance!"
        If the average score is between 70 and 89, print "Good performance!"
        If the average score is below 70, print "Needs improvement!"

Final Notes:

    Test your code after each part to ensure that it works correctly.
    Hint: Break each problem into smaller steps and solve them one by one.
    Optional: Try to complete the bonus task if you finish early!
